To do:
Mandatory Extensions:
- Give the admin user the ability to undo every action taken by regular users that can reasonably be undone.
- (James) Have your program automatically suggest items to lend to a given user, if there is something that is both on
one person's wish list and the other's lending list. In other words, when the user sees something they want to borrow,
they can ask the program for a suggestion of what they could lend this user in return.
- (Navnee) Create a new type of account that allows a user to look at the various parts of the program without being
able to trade or communicate with the admin user. This would be useful, if you ever wanted to set up the program as a
demo for people to explore without creating an account and joining the trading community.
- (Jeff) Allow the admin user to adjust all of the threshold values, either from inside the program or by typing into a
text file.
- (Ryan) Create another status for accounts besides frozen and unfrozen. For example, you can allow accounts to be taken
down by the user for the duration of a vacation, when then will not be able to trade. You are only required to implement
one additional account status. But if you want to implement four or more, it can count towards the next list.
      Some ideas:
      - Exempt from frozen, user exempt from frozen won't alert admins when they are greedy
      - Inactive, users that set themselves as inactive will not show up in user Catalogue
      - Busy status, if they have a meeting at that time, they cannot have another meeting
      - Reported Status, a user has been reported by another user (Add a class that can goes to the admins that
      gives the users reported classes and the reason for the report, maybe add a warning status)
      - Fraud warning status that can have too many frauds, user can send admins fraud reports and admins can flag users
      for Fraud


Optional Extensions: (Pick 4)
- Allow users to enter their home city when creating an account, so that the system will only show them other users in
 the same city.
- Monetize the system. In other words, give users the option to sell or trade items.
- Have the automated trade suggestion always return the most reasonable trade, even if it's not an exact match.
- Create a points system that allows users who trade most frequently, to get an extra chance to borrow without it
counting towards being frozen, or some other "prize" that is equally complicated.
- Give your Admin user more functionality than Phase 1 and "undo" abilities.
- Expand the types of trades you can do. Possibilities include three-way trades, where A lends to B who lends to C who
lends to A, or no-meeting trades where the users email each other media files.
- Include a number of different types of accounts or statuses for an account. Above, we talked about potentially
allowing a user to temporarily make their account invisible to other users when they go away on vacation.
Create at least three other ways to temporarily or permanently modify the capabilities of a given user's account.
These could be applied by the user, the admin user, or both.
- Replace your text UI with a Graphic User Interface (GUI). Counts as 2

Fixes that need to be done:
- (Navnee) Separate Trader into a smaller class
- (Sasan) Separate Inbox into a smaller class
- Change "newUser" method in TradingSystem (UI) into it's own controller class
- Add a method that can create an admin in the same class
- TraderInbox should be fixed to do something else, because it only implements the abstract class
- Fix the menu so it's more comprehensive and less cluttered
- Add to a return to main menu option, in every menu option
- Change necessary methods to private or package protected, too many methods are public
- Change isInteger option into it's own class, it is in AdminOptions, InboxOptions, AcceptedTradeOptions, TradeOptions)
into it's own class
